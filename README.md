OneHourBuilds
=============

The purpose of this repo is simple: explore new technologies by building whatever I can in an hour. Here's how it breaks down:

1. Create a spec that is straight-forward and rock-solid that clearly defines the scope of the project.
2. Set a timer, down some caffeine, and get started programming
3. Finish the project (hopefully in an hour or less)
4. Document the SLOC and the concepts covered by the application (e.g., submitting a form using ember.js)
5. Document any issues that were encountered while coding (especially if the project went over one hour)
